# Nordic World Ski Championships 2021

The FIS Nordic World Ski Championship is a nordic ski event organized by the International Ski Federation (FIS). The event takes place every two years, and includes three of the disciplines in nordic skiing: cross-country skiing, ski jumping and nordic combined, where nordic combined is a combination of both cross-country skiing and ski jumping.

In 2021 the ski event was held in Oberstdorf, between February 25 and March 7. 
This was the 42nd edition, and the third time Oberstdorf hosts the world championship.

This repository will contain some visualizations from the event, mostly the cross-country ski races.

#### Sprint
Sprint races are maximum 1.8 kilometres. In sprint races, athletes start with a prologue, where the 30 fastest skiers qualify for the sprint's quarterfinals. There are 5 quarterfinals, with 6 skiers in each heat. The 12 best skiers in the quarterfinals advance to the semifinals and the 6 best skiers in the semifinals advance to the final.

Below is a graphical recap of the sprint. The x-axis is kept fixed to make it easier to compare speed between the heats.
